# 2- IaC Concepts
### The Problem with Manual Configuration
* Its easy to misconfigure a service through human error 
* Its hard to manage the expected state of configuration for compliance
* Its hard to transfer configuration knowledge to other team members
### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
You write a configuration script to automate creating, updating, or destroying cloud infrastructure.
* IaC is a blueprint of your infrastructure
* IaC allows you to easily share, version, or inventory your cloud infrastructure.

### Infrastructure Lifecycle
the idea of having clearly defined and distinct work phases which are used by DevOps Engineers to plan, design, build, test, and deliver, maintain and retire cloud infrastructure.
* Day 0 - Plan and Design
* Day 1 - Develop and Iterate
* Day 2 - Go live and maintain
